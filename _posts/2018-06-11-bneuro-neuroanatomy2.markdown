 > Everything has to do with your nervous system -Jonathon Lipnicki

#### Things to Remember:
1. The nervous system is comprised of the *central nervous system (CNS)* and the *peripheral nervous system (PNS)*
2. The purpose of the nervous system to transport messages all over the body as quickly and efficiently as possible
3. Scientists like to make up fancy words so they sound smart
4. Anatomy, especially neuroanatomy, is about learning these made-up words so you can talk about very specific areas of the body.

The fundamental concept of this section is:

> How does the Nervous System work?

We are going to structure our tour of the nervous system by separating neuroanatomy into
* Input: How signals are first generated
* Processing: How signals are interpreted
* Output: How the body responds to signals

## Input

Most signals enter the nervous system through **nerves** (duh) which are a collection of axons that carry information to and from the CNS.

There are 12 cranial nerves which carry information about senses in the head and internal organs.

Spinal Nerves carrying sensory information enter the CNS through the **Dorsal Root**, which is a fancy word for the back of the spine. Motor information exits the CNS through the **Ventral Root**, or front of spine

All sensory inputs (except smell) then travel to the **Thalamus**, the post office of the brain, to be distributed to appropriate brain region.

## Processing

As the above picture shows, there are _a lot_ of brain regions. If you want to memorize all of them, eat your heart out.

Otherwise, here are a few important areas I've chosen to highlight:

#### Cerebral Cortex

The "wrinkly" part of the brain that wraps around the outside. It is essentially a 2-D sheet, with a depth of only about 4mm.

It is responsible for perception, learning, memory, planning, and decisions. Also 40% of the cortex is dedicated to vision.

#### Cerebellum

The back-bottom of the brain that looks separate from the wrinkly cerebral cortex.

It is responsible for reconciling sensory and motor maps, synaptic plasticity, and  motor coordination.

#### Brainstem

Comprised of the midbrain, Pons, and Medulla. Often called the "Reptilian brain" because it is older and deals with more _fundamental_ processes.

It is responsible for breathing, heart rate and pressure, eating, and sexual arousal.

## Output

The literal output of the nervous system comes in the form of a memories, hormones, and behaviors. While later posts will deal with these outputs more in depth, right now we will briefly go over a few key structures:

#### Limbic System

Primary Structures are:
* **Hippocampus**: Deals with transferring short-term memory to long-term (_not_ where memories are stored however). I'm sure you've noticed that attention, smell, and emotion have a particularly strong effect on memories. This is because the structures responsible for those attributes (*Cingulate Gyrus*,*Olfactory Bulb*,and *Amygdala* respectively) are closely wired to the Hippocampus.
* **Hypothalamus**: Regulates hormone levels in the body. Also controls the **Autonomic Nervous System**

#### Autonomic Nervous System

An automatic response system that spans both the CNS and PNS. It is broken down into two parts:
* **Sympathetic Division**: The "fight or flight" response in the body. It is found in the middle of the spine (Thoracic and Lumbar) and releases hormones throughout the body. If you've ever been scared, you have activated the sympathetic division of your autonomic nervous system
* **Parasympathetic Divison**: The "rest or digest" response in the body. It is found at the top and bottom of the spine (Cranial and Sacral) and releases hormones in targeted areas very close to organs.

## Recap

1. The Brain is part of the Nervous System, which is simply a structure that receives, processes, and responds to stimuli
2. Understanding the basic concepts is more important than memorizing the vocab
